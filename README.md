# Quantum-Forge-Simulator

Welcome to Quantum-Forge-Simulator (QFS), an advanced graphical user interface designed to facilitate atomistic calculations using RESCU and NanoDCAL—two powerful computational tools developed by Nanoacademic Technologies.

About Quantum-Forge-Simulator

Quantum-Forge-Simulator is a GUI-based simulation environment that enables users to perform complex quantum and electronic structure calculations. It integrates RESCU, a density functional theory (DFT) solver, and NanoDCAL, a quantum transport modeling software, into a streamlined and user-friendly platform.

Key Features

Intuitive graphical interface for configuring and executing DFT and quantum transport calculations.

Seamless integration of RESCU and NanoDCAL (requires valid licenses).

Support for a wide range of quantum materials simulations.

Advanced visualization and analysis tools.

Built-in job management system for handling multiple calculations efficiently.

Integrated Calculation Software

RESCU – Density Functional Theory Solver

RESCU is a powerful DFT solver based on the Kohn-Sham formalism. It enables researchers to simulate electronic structures, material properties, and advanced quantum phenomena using real-space discretization. Key features include:

Support for LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, hybrid functionals.

Parallelized computations with GPU acceleration.

Accurate Bravais lattice symmetry detection.

Calculation of band structures, density of states (DOS), and phonon properties.

Advanced pseudopotential library for LDA/GGA approximations.

NanoDCAL – Quantum Transport Modeling

NanoDCAL is a state-of-the-art quantum transport simulation software based on the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) formalism. It provides:

Atomistic modeling of nanodevices, molecules, and crystals.

Self-consistent DFT-NEGF calculations.

Simulation of magneto-transport, spintronics, and tunneling effects.

Multi-probe transport calculations for complex nanoscale devices.

Full parallelization for high-performance computing environments.
